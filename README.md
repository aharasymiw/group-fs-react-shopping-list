### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://postgresapp.com/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `fs-react-shopping`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your terminal of choice and run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal, will run the server on port 5000.
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal, will run the react server for the client on port 3000.
6. The `npm run client` command will also open up a new browser tab for you
